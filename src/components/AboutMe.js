                    Ever since personal computers came out, I've been spending my time (most of it), playing games.<br/>
                    And when the internet became faster then 56k, and I was able to play online game, I spent even more time on my computer.<br/>
                    While playing games and exploring the Web, I began to gain interest in photoshop, creating signaturs for people in forums, and just creating random pictures regarding my hobbies such as Anime and well, more games..<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I've been searching for something to satisfy my need for creation, for creativity and interest, and fortunatly - Coding , was the answer.<br/>

                    During my study at SV College, I wanted to know more and more about what I'm learning, how to create my own site, my own application.<br/>

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    These days I'm spending my time learning more about JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React and learning new things such as JQuery.
                    <br/>
                    Practicing and Developing my own Web-App.
                    <br/>
                    And watching movies,TV series and playing online games.
